    <p>Running With Rifles Stats (RWRS) is a site (but not only!) created by and for <a href="http://www.runningwithrifles.com/">Running With Rifles</a> (RWR) players: it aims to be your everyday RWR companion tool.</p>
    <p><em>If you don't know RWR already: it's a very noice top-down shooter game. There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/{{ config['RWR_STEAM_APP_ID'] }}">free demo</a> waiting for you!</em></p>

    <h2>What's RWRS?</h2>

    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/rwr_cover.jpg') }}" class="bordered fr">

    <p>RWR may be played online on ranked (official) servers with other people. Ranked servers for vanilla RWR are called "Invasion", the ones for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/616850/RUNNING_WITH_RIFLES_PACIFIC/">Pacific</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1210750/RUNNING_WITH_RIFLES_EDELWEISS/">Edelweiss</a> DLCs are called "Pacific and Edelweiss".</p>
    <p>Players profile on these servers are persisted (just like Battlefield): RWRS allows you to check your player profile statistics for these servers, as well as access to the public servers list (server browser).</p>
    <p>But it's not limited to these features, RWRS can do way more things. There's also a handy Discord bot available on the <a href="{{ config['DISCORD_SERVER_URL'] }}">official RWR Discord server</a> (<strong>#rwrs-bot</strong> channel).</p>

    <h2>Author and genesis</h2>

    <p>RWRS was created by <a href="https://epoc.fr/">Maxime "Epoc" G.</a> (AKA EpocDotFr) out of the frustration of the <a href="http://rwr.runningwithrifles.com/rwr_server_list/view_servers.php" rel="nofollow">official servers list</a> and <a href="http://rwr.runningwithrifles.com/rwr_stats/view_players.php?sort=score" rel="nofollow">official players list</a> pages not being user-friendly and not giving valuable information for us, players. RWRS was then born on October 3, 2017.</p>
